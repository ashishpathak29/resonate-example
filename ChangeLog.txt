	modified getPageAvailable() to check for next and previous overrides set in the manifest.xml

Page Class:
	add property nextOverride - stores the the page that should be navigated to when the next button is hit, or null for default
	add property prevOverride - stores the the page that should be navigated to when the next button is hit, or null for default


Version 2.0.44 
Release date 04/22/2105 
Commited by Christopher Swenson

Changes:

Add the ability to use hidden pages (pages that do not effect the page numbering.)


Updated version numbering in index.html
Updated Resonate.js to include the following:

	Course Class:
	added private method _calcResolvedIndex(page); to calculate the true index of the page when using hidden pages
	modified getPageCount(includeHidden = true) to include the includeHidden argument (defaults to true) to get the page count when using hidden pages
	
	Container Class:
	added private method _calcResolvedIndex(page); to calculate the true index of the page when using hidden pages
	modified getPageCount(includeHidden = true) to include the includeHidden argument (defaults to true) to get the page count when using hidden pages

	Page Class:
	added resolvedIndex property holds the true index of the page within a container when using hidden pages
	added resolvedAbsoluteIndex property holds the true index of the page within the entire course when using hidden pages

Example usage: 

Adding a hidden attribute to a page within the manifest will hide the page from the page count

		<page id="pres_010" hidden="true">
			<data file="pages/absolutes.html">Absolutes</data>
		</page>	

Fixed issue with titleDepth="0" in the manifest where the 0 was seen as null and then the titleDepth would default to 2
